### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt. I'm a self taught full-stack developer based in Chicago. I like learning, tinkering, breaking/fixing, problem solving in Javascript (and a very, very little bit of Python).
<!--
**MattRueter/MattRueter** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Team Forward & Idiom.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript best practices.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) or [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) if you are new to web development and want some encouragement.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-matthew-rueter/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Though there are plenty of good resources on the internet I still like sitting with a book sometimes. A couple I recommend are...
  * Learning Javascript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani [also free online](https://www.patterns.dev/)
  * Good Code, Bad Code by Tom Long
