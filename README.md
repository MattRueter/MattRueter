### Hi there 👋
My name is Matt. I'm a software developer based in Chicago. I like learning, tinkering, breaking/fixing things, and problem solving in Javascript (and a little bit in Python as well).
<!--
**MattRueter/MattRueter** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ⚡ At the moment I'm working on [Idiom](https://blog.parlanchin.com/blog/introducing-idiom/) and [Palabrisa](https://blog.parlanchin.com/blog/introducing-palabrisa/)
- ⚡ I’m currently learning basics of NLP using NLTK and SpaCY as well as Python backend development with FastAPI.
- ⚡ Ask me about [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) or [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) if you are new to web development and want some encouragement.
- ⚡ How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-matthew-rueter/)
- ⚡ I blog at [Parlanchín](https://blog.parlanchin.com/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Though there are plenty of good resources on the internet I still like sitting with a book sometimes. A couple I recommend are...
  * Learning Javascript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani [also free online](https://www.patterns.dev/)
  * Good Code, Bad Code by Tom Long from [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/books/good-code-bad-code)
  * Think Like a Programmer by V. Anton Spraul from [no startch press](https://nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer)
