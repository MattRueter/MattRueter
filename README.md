### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt. I'm a software developer based in Madrid. I like learning, tinkering, breaking/fixing things, and problem solving in Javascript (and a little bit in Python as well).
<!--
**MattRueter/MattRueter** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- âš¡ At the moment I'm working on [Idiom](https://blog.parlanchin.com/blog/introducing-idiom/) and [Palabrisa](https://blog.parlanchin.com/blog/introducing-palabrisa/)
- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently learning basics of NLP using NLTK and SpaCY as well as Python backend development with FastAPI.
- âš¡ Ask me about [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) or [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) if you are new to web development and want some encouragement.
- âš¡ How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-matthew-rueter/)
- âš¡ I blog at [ParlanchÃ­n](https://blog.parlanchin.com/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Though there are plenty of good resources on the internet I still like sitting with a book sometimes. A couple I recommend are...
  * Learning Javascript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani [also free online](https://www.patterns.dev/)
  * Good Code, Bad Code by Tom Long from [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/books/good-code-bad-code)
  * Think Like a Programmer by V. Anton Spraul from [no startch press](https://nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer)
